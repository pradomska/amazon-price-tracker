# amazon-price-tracker

There is a really cool website that called camelcamelcamel.com where you can simply take a product's URL, so you select the size you want, the style, the item, whatever it may be, and then you take the URL and you paste it into camelcamelcamel.com and it will give you the price history of that product.

Using what I've learned, and then on that day, I get an email and it tells me *** price alert, the product price is now $ below your target price, go ahead and buy now. So this is basically the functionality that I want to build using my knowledge of Python and web scraping.
